# Chapter 7: Sensor Simulation - Eyes and Ears for Robots

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being written. It will cover:

**Learning Objectives:**
- Simulate cameras, depth sensors, LiDAR, and IMUs
- Understand sensor models and noise
- Visualize sensor data in RViz2
- Process RGB-D for 3D perception

**Topics:**
- Camera models and simulation
- RGB-D sensors for depth perception
- LiDAR for obstacle detection
- IMU for orientation sensing

**What You'll Build:**
- Multi-camera vision system (360° coverage)
- LiDAR-based obstacle detection
- Sensor visualization pipeline
