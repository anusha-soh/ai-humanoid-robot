# Chapter 16: Capstone - The Autonomous Humanoid Butler

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being written. It will cover:

**Learning Objectives:**
- Integrate all previous modules into one system
- Debug complex multi-component systems
- Optimize performance for real-time execution
- Understand sim-to-real transfer challenges

**Topics:**
- System integration best practices
- Debugging strategies for robotics
- Performance optimization
- Future directions: Sim-to-real transfer

**Capstone Project:**
Build a simulated humanoid butler that:
1. Listens for voice commands ("Bring me a snack")
2. Plans action sequences using LLM
3. Navigates to kitchen using Nav2
4. Detects and identifies snacks with computer vision
5. Returns to human and reports completion

**Extensions:**
- Beginner: Multi-room navigation
- Intermediate: Multiple object types
- Advanced: Obstacle handling and recovery
