# Chapter 10: Perception Pipelines - Object Detection

## Coming Soon

This chapter is currently being written. It will cover:

**Learning Objectives:**
- Build computer vision pipelines for robots
- Run YOLO object detection models
- Convert 2D bounding boxes to 3D poses
- Publish detection results via ROS 2

**Topics:**
- Object detection with YOLO
- ROS 2 image transport
- 2D-to-3D pose estimation
- Real-time inference pipelines

**What You'll Build:**
- Object detection on robot camera feed
- "Fetch the cup" behavior
- Vision-based navigation

**Note:** Works with both Isaac Sim and Gazebo.
